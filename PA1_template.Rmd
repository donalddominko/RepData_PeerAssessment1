## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{R}
        unzip("activity.zip")
        fdRead = read.csv("activity.csv", sep = ",", header=T)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{R}
        # Calculating sum
        agStepsSum = aggregate(dfRead$steps, list(date=dfRead$date), sum)
        
        # Calculating mean
        #agStepsMean = aggregate(agStepsSum$x, list(date=agStepsSum$date), mean)
        mean(na.omit(agStepsSum$x))
        
        # Calculating median
        #agStepsMedian = aggregate(agStepsSum$x, list(date=agStepsSum$date), median)
        median(na.omit(agStepsSum$x))
        
        # Making a historgram of the total number of steps taken each day
        hist(agStepsSum$x, col = "green")
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
